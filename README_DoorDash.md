# DoorDash Customer Behavior Analysis 📦

This project explores real-world customer data from DoorDash to understand what drives spending, retention, and customer lifetime value.

## 📈 Project Goal
To identify trends in user behavior and deliver actionable insights for customer retention, profitability, and long-term growth strategy.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- 🥇 **The top 25% of customers drive nearly 80% of revenue** — a classic Pareto distribution.
- ⏳ **Customer lifecycle lengths vary dramatically**, with some users active for over 2,000 days.
- 🧓 **Older customers tend to spend more** and stay loyal longer, suggesting high-value retention segments.
- 🛍️ **Customers who spend the most** aren’t necessarily those who order most frequently — indicating order size matters.

## 💼 Business Applications
- Target high-value customers with exclusive perks or loyalty campaigns.
- Reassess marketing focus: frequent users ≠ most profitable users.
- Invest in long-term retention strategies, especially for older or high-ARPU users.
