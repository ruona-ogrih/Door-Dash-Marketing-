# DoorDash Customer Behavior Analysis 

This project explores real-world customer data from DoorDash to understand what drives spending, retention, and customer lifetime value.

## Project Goal
To identify trends in user behavior and deliver actionable insights for customer retention, profitability, and long-term growth strategy.

## Key Insights
-  **The top 25% of customers drive nearly 80% of revenue** â€” a classic Pareto distribution.
-  **Customer lifecycle lengths vary dramatically**, with some users active for over 2,000 days.
-  **Older customers tend to spend more** and stay loyal longer, suggesting high-value retention segments.
-  **Customers who spend the most** arenâ€™t necessarily those who order most frequently â€” indicating order size matters.

##  Business Applications
- Target high-value customers with exclusive perks or loyalty campaigns.
- Reassess marketing focus: frequent users â‰  most profitable users.
- Invest in long-term retention strategies, especially for older or high-ARPU users.
